# Notes

## What is currently driving inflation?

Inflation is often tracked as overall inflation and core inflation. Core inflation excludes energy and food price, which tend to be particularly volatile. As inflation heated up in the second half of 2021, overall inflation grew much faster than core inflation. So early inflation was largely a ["food and energy" story](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/09/09/cotw-how-food-and-energy-are-driving-the-global-inflation-surge), fueled by supply disruptions from the war in Ukraine.

However, the most recent data is showing core and overall inflation beginning to converge, and yet inflation remains high. This suggests that inflation is affecting a broad set of prices. This is a common pattern where higher energy prices drive higher prices in other areas of the economy.
